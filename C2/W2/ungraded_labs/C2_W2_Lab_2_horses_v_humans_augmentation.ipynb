    "In the previous lab, you saw how data augmentation helped improve the model's performance on unseen data. By tweaking the cat and dog training images, the model was able to learn features that are also representative of the validation data. However, applying data augmentation requires good understanding of your dataset. Simply transforming it randomly will not always yield good results. \n",

    "As you can see in the results, the preprocessing techniques used in augmenting the data did not help much in the results. The validation accuracy is fluctuating and not trending up like the training accuracy. This might be because the additional training data generated still do not represent the features in the validation data. For example, some human or horse poses in the validation set cannot be mimicked by the image processing techniques that `ImageDataGenerator` provides. It might also be that the background of the training images are also learned so the white background of the validation set is throwing the model off even with cropping. Try looking at the validation images in the `tmp/validation-horse-or-human` directory (note: if you are using Colab, you can use the file explorer on the left to explore the images) and see if you can augment the training images to match its characteristics. If this is not possible, then at this point you can consider other techniques and you will see that in next week's lessons."
