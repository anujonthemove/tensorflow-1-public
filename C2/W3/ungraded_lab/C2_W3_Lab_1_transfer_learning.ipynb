This is called _transfer learning_ and you do this by leveraging the trained layers of an existing model and adding your own layers to fit your application. For example, you can:\n",

This is because the original last layer might be too specialized in what it has learned so it might not translate well into your application. `mixed_7` on the other hand will be more generalized and you can start with that for your application.
